### Module 5: Objects

#### Activity 1: Introduction to objects
- Understanding the concept of objects and their role in Python.
- Exploring the syntax for creating objects using dictionaries.
- Learning about key-value pairs and accessing object properties.
- Understanding object methods and their usage.

#### Activity 2: Creating objects
- Creating objects using classes and instantiation.
- Defining classes with the `class` keyword.
- Initializing object properties in the class constructor (`__init__` method).
- Exploring class methods and attributes.

#### Activity 3: Object properties and methods
- Working with object properties and accessing them using dot notation.
- Modifying object properties and adding new properties dynamically.
- Understanding the concept of `self` and its usage in object methods.
- Exploring built-in Python objects and their methods.

#### Practice Exercises:
1. Create a person object:
   - Create a class called `Person` with properties for `name`, `age`, and `occupation`.
   - Add a method to the class called `introduce` that prints a message introducing the person.
   - Create an instance of the `Person` class and call the `introduce` method.

2. Calculate the area of a rectangle using an object:
   - Create a class called `Rectangle` with properties for `width` and `height`.
   - Add a method to the class called `calculate_area` that calculates the area of the rectangle.
   - Create an instance of the `Rectangle` class and call the `calculate_area` method.

3. Create a bank account object:
   - Create a class called `BankAccount` with properties for `account_number`, `balance`, and `owner_name`.
   - Add methods to the class for `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `get_balance`.
   - Create an instance of the `BankAccount` class and perform transactions using the methods.
