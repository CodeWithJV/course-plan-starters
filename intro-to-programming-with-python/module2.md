### Module 2: Variables and Data Types

#### Activity 1: What are variables?
- Understanding what variables are and their importance in programming.
- Exploring the concept of variables as containers for storing and manipulating data.
- Learning about variable naming conventions and best practices.

#### Activity 2: Declaring and assigning variables
- Learning how to declare variables in Python.
- Understanding variable assignment and the use of the assignment operator `=`.
- Exploring different ways to assign values to variables, including literals and expressions.

#### Activity 3: Data types in Python
- Exploring the different data types available in Python, including:
  - Numeric types: Integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers.
  - Strings: Manipulating and concatenating strings.
  - Booleans: Working with `True` and `False` values.
  - None: Understanding the special `None` value.
  - Lists: Introduction to lists and their operations.
  - Dictionaries: Introduction to dictionaries and key-value pairs.
- Understanding type inference and explicit type declarations in Python.

#### Practice Exercises:
1. Calculate the area of a rectangle:
   - Declare two variables, `width` and `height`, and assign them appropriate values.
   - Calculate the area of the rectangle by multiplying `width` and `height`.
   - Store the result in a variable called `area`.
   - Finally, print the value of `area`.

2. Concatenate strings:
   - Declare two variables, `first_name` and `last_name`, and assign them your first and last name, respectively.
   - Create a new variable called `full_name` and concatenate `first_name` and `last_name`.
   - Finally, print the value of `full_name`.

3. Determine the data type:
   - Declare a variable called `data` and assign it a value of your choice.
   - Use the `type()` function to determine the data type of `data`.
   - Finally, print the result.

Estimated time to complete this module is approximately 4-6 hours.
