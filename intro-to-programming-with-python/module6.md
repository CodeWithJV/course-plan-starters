### Module 6: Project

#### Activity 1: Project - Create a simple guessing game using Python
- In this project, you will apply the knowledge and skills you have acquired throughout the course to create a simple guessing game using Python.
- The game should generate a random number between a specified range and prompt the player to guess the number.
- The player should be given a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number.
- After each guess, the game should provide feedback to the player, indicating if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- The game should keep track of the number of attempts made by the player and provide a message indicating whether the player won or lost the game.
- You are encouraged to be creative and add additional features to the game, such as a score system or difficulty levels.

Estimated time to complete this module is approximately 6-8 hours, depending on the complexity of the additional features you choose to implement.

To further enhance your learning and assist you with the project, here are some additional resources:

- Python Documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/
- Real Python's Python Projects for Beginners: https://realpython.com/tutorials/projects/
- Invent with Python by Al Sweigart: https://inventwithpython.com/

Feel free to explore and experiment with different ideas to make the guessing game your own. Remember to break down the problem into smaller tasks and plan your approach before starting the implementation.

Good luck with your project, and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions or need further assistance!
