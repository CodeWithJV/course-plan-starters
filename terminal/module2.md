## Module 2: Command Chains and Filters

### Learning Objectives:
- Understand the concept of command chaining and its applications
- Learn about input/output redirection and its usage
- Explore powerful command-line filters like grep, awk, and sed

### Activities:
1. **Lesson: Command Chaining**
   - Introduction to command chaining and its benefits
   - Chaining commands using pipes (`|`) for data flow
   - Examples of command chains for efficient data processing
   
2. **Lesson: Input/Output Redirection**
   - Redirecting command output to a file using `>`
   - Appending command output to a file using `>>`
   - Redirecting input from a file using `<`
   - Combining input/output redirection and command chaining
   
3. **Lesson: Powerful Command-Line Filters**
   - Using `grep` to search for specific patterns in files
   - Filtering and processing text using regular expressions
   - Extracting specific columns of data using `awk`
   - Stream editing with `sed` for search and replace operations
   
4. **Exercise: Command Chains and Filters**
   - Create command chains to process and filter data
   - Use input/output redirection to store command output in files
   - Apply grep, awk, and sed to extract and manipulate text data
