#### Practice Exercises:
1. Create a person object:
   - Create an object called `person` with properties for `name`, `age`, and `occupation`.
   - Add a method to the object called `introduce` that prints a message introducing the person.
   - Call the `introduce` method on the `person` object and log the result to the console.

2. Calculate the area of a rectangle using an object:
   - Create an object called `rectangle` with properties for `width` and `height`.
   - Add a method to the object called `calculateArea` that calculates the area of the rectangle.
   - Call the `calculateArea` method on the `rectangle` object and log the result to the console.

3. Create a bank account object:
   - Create an object called `bankAccount` with properties for `accountNumber`, `balance`, and `ownerName`.
   - Add methods to the object for `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `getBalance`.
   - Call the methods on the `bankAccount` object to perform transactions and log the results to the console.
