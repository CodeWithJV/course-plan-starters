### Module 3: Control Structures

#### Activity 1: Conditional statements
- Understanding conditional statements and their role in programming.
- Exploring the `if` statement and its syntax.
- Using comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`) to create conditions.
- Understanding the `else if` and `else` statements for handling multiple conditions.

#### Activity 2: Looping statements
- Understanding looping statements and their role in repeating actions.
- Exploring the `for` loop and its syntax.
- Using the `for` loop to iterate over a range of values.
- Exploring the `while` loop and its syntax.
- Understanding the `do-while` loop and its differences from the `while` loop.

#### Practice Exercises:
1. Print even numbers:
   - Write a program that prints all even numbers from 1 to 20.
   - Use a looping statement to iterate over the numbers.
   - Check if each number is even using a conditional statement.
   - Print the even numbers to the console.

2. Temperature conversion:
   - Write a program that converts temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
   - Prompt the user for a temperature in Celsius.
   - Use a conditional statement to check if the input is valid.
   - If valid, convert the temperature to Fahrenheit using the formula: `F = (C * 9/5) + 32`.
   - Print the converted temperature to the console.

3. Find the maximum number:
   - Write a program that finds the maximum number from a given array of numbers.
   - Use a loop to iterate over the array elements.
   - Keep track of the maximum number encountered so far using a variable.
   - After the loop, print the maximum number to the console.

Estimated time to complete this module is approximately 4-6 hours.
