### Module 2: Variables and Data Types

#### Activity 1: What are variables?
- Understanding what variables are and their importance in programming.
- Exploring the concept of variables as containers for storing and manipulating data.
- Learning about variable naming conventions and best practices.

#### Activity 2: Declaring and assigning variables
- Learning how to declare variables using the `var`, `let`, and `const` keywords.
- Understanding the difference between mutable and immutable variables.
- Assigning values to variables using the assignment operator `=`.
- Exploring different ways to assign values to variables, including literals and expressions.

#### Activity 3: Data types in JavaScript
- Exploring the different data types available in JavaScript, including:
  - Numbers: Understanding number literals and operations.
  - Strings: Manipulating and concatenating strings.
  - Booleans: Working with true and false values.
  - Null and undefined: Understanding these special values.
  - Objects: Introduction to objects and their properties.
- Understanding type coercion and implicit type conversions in JavaScript.

#### Practice Exercises:
1. Calculate the area of a rectangle:
   - Declare two variables, `width` and `height`, and assign them appropriate values.
   - Calculate the area of the rectangle by multiplying `width` and `height`.
   - Store the result in a variable called `area`.
   - Finally, log the value of `area` to the console.

2. Concatenate strings:
   - Declare two variables, `firstName` and `lastName`, and assign them your first and last name respectively.
   - Create a new variable called `fullName` and concatenate `firstName` and `lastName`.
   - Finally, log the value of `fullName` to the console.

3. Determine the data type:
   - Declare a variable called `data` and assign it a value of your choice.
   - Use the `typeof` operator to determine the data type of `data`.
   - Finally, log the result to the console.

Estimated time to complete this module is approximately 4-6 hours.
