### Module 4: Functions

#### Activity 1: Introduction to functions
- Understanding the concept of functions and their importance in programming.
- Exploring the syntax of function declaration and function expressions.
- Learning about function names and best practices for naming functions.
- Understanding the purpose of function documentation and comments.

#### Activity 2: Declaring and calling functions
- Declaring functions with parameters and return statements.
- Calling functions and passing arguments.
- Understanding function scope and variable visibility.
- Exploring function hoisting and function expressions.

#### Activity 3: Parameters and return values
- Working with function parameters and understanding their role in passing data to functions.
- Exploring different types of function parameters: required parameters, default parameters, and rest parameters.
- Using return statements to return values from functions.
- Understanding the concept of function purity and side effects.

#### Practice Exercises:
1. Calculate the area of a circle:
   - Write a function called `calculateArea` that takes the radius of a circle as a parameter.
   - Inside the function, calculate the area of the circle using the formula: `area = Math.PI * radius * radius`.
   - Return the calculated area from the function.
   - Call the function with different radius values and log the result to the console.

2. Reverse a string:
   - Write a function called `reverseString` that takes a string as a parameter.
   - Inside the function, reverse the order of characters in the string.
   - Return the reversed string from the function.
   - Call the function with different strings and log the result to the console.

3. Check if a number is prime:
   - Write a function called `isPrime` that takes a number as a parameter.
   - Inside the function, check if the number is prime (i.e., divisible only by 1 and itself).
   - Return `true` if the number is prime, and `false` otherwise.
   - Call the function with different numbers and log the result to the console.

Estimated time to complete this module is approximately 4-6 hours.
