# CodeWithJV Course Plan Examples

This repository demonstrates curriculum created by the [AI Tutor](https://github.com/CodeWithJV/ai-tutor) ([video intro here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_YDpDgZvk)) repository.
Both courses have been designed to be beginner friendly and cover the basics of coding in either javascript or python.

Feel free to modify any of the courses to add or remove modules or activities or convert them into the language of your choice. These sample courses are intended as a starting point for your own learning journey and can be customized to suit your needs.

## Getting Started

To get started with the sample courses, follow these steps:

1. Get the code prompt from the [AI Tutor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeWithJV/ai-tutor/main/init.md) by pasting the tutor prompt, course, and module into ChatGPT.
2. Use commands like the following in the ChatGPT:
   - `teach me activity [n]` to learn step-by-step about a specific activity.
   - `test my knowledge of this module` to assess your understanding of the module.
   - `walk me through the practice exercise one step at a time, I would like to code along` to receive a guided walkthrough of a practice exercise.
3. Refer to the corresponding markdown files for each course and module in this repository to access the course content and materials.

What questions do you think you could ask ChatGPT to extend this curriculum into more advanced aspects of the languages?
