## Getting Started

To get started with the sample courses, follow these steps:

1. Get the code prompt from the [AI Tutor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeWithJV/ai-tutor/main/init.md) by pasting the tutor prompt, course, and module into ChatGPT.
2. Use commands like the following in the ChatGPT:
   - `teach me activity [n]` to learn step-by-step about a specific activity.
   - `test my knowledge of this module` to assess your understanding of the module.
   - `walk me through the practice exercise one step at a time, I would like to code along` to receive a guided walkthrough of a practice exercise.
3. Refer to the corresponding markdown files for each course and module in this repository to access the course content and materials.

Feel free to modify any of the courses or convert them into the language of your choice. These sample courses serve as a starting point for your own learning journey and can be customized to suit your needs.
